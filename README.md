# Text Adventure Game

This is an interactive text-based game in the style of "choose your own adventure," where users can influence the course of events. The story is randomly generated, and each user choice leads to a new plot twist.

## Description

The app provides the user with unique text scenarios that evolve based on the user's input. The app uses the OpenAI API to generate text and displays it on the screen, allowing the player to influence the course of events.

### Key Features:

- Randomly generated stories on various themes.
- Users can enter commands (e.g., "climb the tree", "walk down the road") to continue the story.
- The OpenAI API is used for dynamic text generation.
- Frontend built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**.
- All requests and data are handled via **Axios** with no need for a backend.

## Technologies

- **React** + **TypeScript** — for building the user interface.
- **Vite** — for fast project build and development.
- **Axios** — for sending requests to the OpenAI API.
- **OpenAI API** — for text generation.
