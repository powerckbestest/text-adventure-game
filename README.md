# Text Adventure Game

This is an interactive text-based game in the style of "choose your own adventure," where users can influence the course of events. The story is randomly generated, and each user choice leads to a new plot twist.

### Key Features:

- Randomly generated stories on various themes.
- Users can enter commands (e.g., "climb the tree", "walk down the road") to continue the story.
